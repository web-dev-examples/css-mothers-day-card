  "&#x1F531; Tips for forking css-mothers-day-card"


Start making a [Fork][css_mothers_day_card__fork_it] of this repository to an account that you have write permissions for.


- Add remote for fork URL. The URL syntax is _`git@github.com:<NAME>/<REPO>.git`_...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/web-dev-examples/css-mothers-day-card

git remote add fork git@github.com:<NAME>/css-mothers-day-card.git
```


- Commit your changes and push to your fork, eg. to fix an issue...

git commit -F- <<'EOF'
:bug: Fixes #42 Issue

EOF


git push fork gh-pages
```


> Note, the `-u` option may be used to set `fork` as the default remote, eg. _`git push -u fork gh-pages`_ however, this will also default the `fork` remote for pulling from too! Meaning that pulling updates from `origin` must be done explicitly, eg. _`git pull origin main`_
